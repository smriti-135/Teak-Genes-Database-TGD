Teak is one of the significant forest trees. Forest ecosystem currently faces a number of major challenges, including anthropogenic pressure, skyrocketing demand for wood, pressure to conserve forest areas, and global climate change and related threats. 
Adaptation of forest tree species in response to these climate and human made challenges will require a multifaceted approach, including genomics.
Teak (*Tectona grandis* L. f.) is a globally prized hardwood tree renowned for its exceptional strength, durability, and aesthetic appeal. 
A lot of research is being undertaken across the world in order to enhance teak wood production, improve wood quality, support agroforestry models, and advance the understanding of wood formation processes. 
Understanding the genetic makeup of teak is crucial for its genetic improvement.

Information on genome, transcriptome and genes related are continuously getting published for teak. 
While existing databases in the public domain offer valuable information, researchers lack a dedicated integrated database specialized in teak. 
The development of ‘Teak Genes Database’ aims to bridge this gap by allowing researchers to easily store, analyse, and share their teak-related genomic data.


**AIM**:

To develop a user-friendly web database of teak genes ‘Teak Genes Database’ to support ongoing teak
research.

**OBJECTIVES**:
- To structure experimentally obtained and validated data into a user-friendly web database of teak for
the use of researchers in ICFRE – Institute of Forest Genetics and Tree Breeding
-  To incorporate basic features and tools in the database.
- To aid the research for enhancing teak wood production, improving wood quality, supporting
agroforestry models, and advancing the understanding of wood formation processes.
