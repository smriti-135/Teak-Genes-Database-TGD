### (Note 1) Functionality of website
One of the main facets to the project was to make it efficient and user friendly instead of overloading it with features. To address this, it has been built on a system dedicated with ample storage and memory. The UI has been made as clean and simple as possible with more focus on content and clarity than aesthetic appeal. 

A detailed User Guide has also been provided in the website. The 'Home' page provides a clear overview of the website's purpose and content, while the 'About' page details the project background. 

The main features of the platform ie, Search, Download, BLAST and JBrowse tools work optimally with no memory issues or server crashes or white screen of death (WSOD) in spite of having a considerable amount of data. The results are displayed in a clutter-free and organised interface with ability to view and download as necessary. 

The website supports use by both anonymous and registered users with certain restrictions and permissions based on the role. This gives users more control and privacy over their own data. This is especially important when using the features like BLAST and JBrowse where users can upload their own files to use the tools. 

The forum is also strictly moderated with restrictions to protect their privacy and integrity. There are also ample ways to contact the lab members, the lab or the institute. 

### (Note 2) Future perspectives
The first course of action was to make the website publicly accessible. As of the time of writing, TGD has been integrated with BIACP Programme Centre Resource Partner on Forest Genetic Resources and Tree Improvement hosted by ICFRE - Indian Council of Forestry Research and Education, Coimbatore Sponsored by Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change, Govt. of India. 

The website is built on Drupal 7 and Tripal 3. Drupal 7’s EOL was recently announced to be in the beginning of 2025. In spite of this, Drupal 7 was chosen because Drupal 10 (the recommended recent version) was not as functional as this one for bioinformatics purposes (as of the time of website development). Also, Dupal 4 (which is compatible with Drupal 10) is yet to be completely developed. Thus, many of its functionalities including the vital modules and tools are unusable or unstable. These projects need to be monitored so that the website can be fully upgraded or ‘migrated’ to the latest versions.

The website has been built primarily on the basis of the expectations and feedback provided by the PI and lab members of the Molecular Genetics lab at ICFRE-IFGTB. However, there is always scope for improvements and tweaks to better the user experience (UX). This can be explored when the website is made public. Another improvement could be to add more tools and functionalities. The current website only caters to the requirements of the lab, but more features can be included to cater to a wider user audience. This could be Venn diagram tools (e.g. JVenn), Galaxy integration etc or others as suggested by users and researachers.

One less-important action could be to use ‘decoupled’ or ‘headless’ CMS: where the backend content management and the frontend presentation layers are separated. Many websites use Drupal for backend and other frontend tech like React or NextJS for front end. This represents a modern, flexible approach to content management and delivery, enabling content to be reused across multiple platforms and devices. This architecture supports the "Create Once, Publish Everywhere" (COPE) principle, enhancing content strategy and user experience. 

The project has the potential to be replicated for other species or be made into a multi-species genome database.
