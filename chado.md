Drupal acts as a complete CMS and thus provides extensive functionalities of both frontend (UI) and backend (database). It is preferred or its robust content management capabilities, supporting structured content and a variety of content types. Most importantly, it simplifies the process of database setup and management by providing UI for configuring and interacting with databases, including the ability to import and export data, manage schema, and potentially link external databases with special modules.

Therefore, all the content created in the above steps resulted in the automatic creation and importation of tables and content by Drupal in PostgreSQL as Chado schema. Any changes made in the front end reflected in the backend automatically

### Chado schema
The Chado schema is designed specifically for bioinformatics applications. Thus it extended the default PostgreSQL with additional tables and relationships tailored to the needs of bioinformatics research such as storing and querying biological data and managing complex relationships between entities such as genes, proteins, experiments, and publications.
