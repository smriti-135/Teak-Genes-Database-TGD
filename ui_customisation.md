## Theme
The theme used for the website was installed from the community-submitted projets at https://www.drupal.org/project/project_theme.

The theme is a slightly customsied version of 'Responsive Green' by [Ankit Hinglajia](https://about.me/ankithinglajia "Ankit  Hinglajia").

## Header and footer
The header was modified to contain an image of the logos of ICFRE, IFGTB, DBT. The footer was modified to include copyright and attributation information of the website. These modifications were made at the ‘page.tpl.php’ template file of the theme ‘responsive green’ at *`/var/www/html/teak-genesdatabase/sites/all/themes/responsive_green/templates/page.tpl.php`* which is responsible for the overall layout of most pages on the website (it defines the template structure, the regions and blocks, including those for the header and footer).
