Other pages with content relevant to the website were added. These were
1. About (about Teak Genes Database and teak)
2. Gallery (teak images)
3. Lab Members (biodata and contact information of lab members current and past)
4. Forum (for users to discuss about teak and teak genome)
5. Email and Contact form (for contacting administrator regarding issues or queries)
6. Help and User guide (with a site map and detailed guide for using the website)
7. Legal Agreements (Terms & Conditions, Privacy Policy, Copyright Policy)
8. User Menu (to edit username and password and manage uploaded files)

These pages were generated as either simple static basic pages via *`Home -> Add Content -> Basic page`* or as Panel pages. A panel page is a custom page layout created with the Panels module. It allows drag-and-drop of different content elements into specific regions of the page, providing a flexible way to design unique layouts for the website beyond the standard content page format. This was done via *`Home -> Administration -> Structure -> Pages -> Panel Page`*.
