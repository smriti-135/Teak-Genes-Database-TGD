## Datasets

The datasets uploaded primarily consist of FASTA and GFF files generated by the chromosome-scale genome assembly by Zhao et al. (2019). It is publicly available at https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.77b2422 and stored at NCBI Bioproject https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/?term=PRJNA493753.<br>

Fasta: teak_tectona_grandis_26Jun2018_7GlFM_fmt_tp.fa <br>
GFF: teak.working_models_HiC_fmtDes_con_sorted.gff <br>
CDS: teak.working_models_HiC.cds_con_sorted.fa <br>
cDNA: teak.working_models_HiC.cdna_con_sorted.fa <br>

Firstly, the files were downloaded and stored at the files directory of the web root i.e., *‘/var/www/html/teakgenes-database/sites/default/files’*. Subsequently uploaded to the website via Chado loaders.<br>

GFF file was loaded via *`Tripal → Data Loaders → Chado GFF3 Loader`*. The nucleotide sequence data associated with it was uploaded using the Chado FASTA loader via *`Tripal → Data Loaders → Chado FASTA Loader`*.<br>
Finally, the imported features were ‘published’ at *`Home -> Administration -> Structure -> Tripal Content Types -> Publish (at top of page) -> Select Content Type (from above steps)`*.


If needed, the maximum upload size and execution time of the server can be increased at *‘/etc/php/8.1/fpm/php.ini’* as follows
```
upload_max_filesize = 1024M
post_max_size = 1024M
max_execution_time = 300
```
Or the settings can be overriden using .htaccess at *‘/var/www/html/teak-genesdatabase/.htaccess’*
```
php_value upload_max_filesize 2048M
php_value post_max_size 2048M
```
